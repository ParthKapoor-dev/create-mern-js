const desc1 = "Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Parth. I`ve developed an NPM package called CREATE-MERN-JS just for you (and a bit for myself too)!"

const desc2 = "Whenever I participated in hackathons or rapid coding sessions, I found it frustrating to repeatedly write the same setup code for every MERN app.So, I decided to simplify the process by creating this package.With CREATE - MERN - JS, you can quickly deploy all the necessary setup code directly into your new project files."

const desc4 = "Happy coding!"
