const desc = "Hi ðŸ‘‹, I 'm Parth & I have developed this NPM Package for you. Well Actually , I did it for myself. Whenever , I was in a Hackathon or rapid-code situation, I always disliked the setup code , the same code I had to write for every app that I made in MERN. So I thought of why not making an Npm package , where I could simply deploy all the setup code directly in my new code file & That's why I build CREATE-MERN-JS. I hope you like it , Also It is an open source project , So You could visit parthkapoor-dev/create-mern-js to add new features & resolve existing issues.";
